When I start the code, o system load the Card pattern to create the keypoints and descriptors.
The camera search for the card and, when find it, the segmentation and recognition occur.
On the prompt is showed the word identified and the correct word after to dictionary analysis.

When the system identify the card and a word, it freeze the image. 
When I remove the card from the front of the camera, the system restarts and a new search is done.
